### Bio
Veronique Savard is a language enthusiast who naturally turned to programming.
She is convinced that coding goes well beyond computers and can impact humans’ lives positively.

After completing a Full Stack Software Development bootcamp with Code Institute, Veronique looked for the best environment to work in. Wanting to explore different avenues, she joined a number of empowering tech communities – such as Diversein, Pyladies, Coding Grace, Ladies that UX, Girls in Tech – and learned from insightful, enterprising women already in the industry. She joined Verizon Media in January 2019 as a software engineering intern. As part of the Trust and Verification team, Veronique’s focus is to limit ad fraud and to ensure relevant advertising content is provided to the consumers.

Veronique relishes the challenge of the constant learning slope that comes with the ever-evolving programming languages and stacks. One thing she particularly enjoys is sharing the knowledge with budding tech geniuses, the ninjas of CoderDojo, when she volunteers at the Dogpatch Labs chapter. When she is not in front of her screen, she is likely attending a meetup, drafting projects to promote diversity and inclusion, or reaching new heights (literally) on a bouldering wall.
